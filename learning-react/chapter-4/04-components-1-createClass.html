    // 3 ways to create react components.
    // 1: createClass
    // createClass was first introduced in 2013 as the only way to create a
    // component. It will likely be deprecated

    // HAHAHA - it IS deprecated, all createClass samples have been removed
    // from the github site - so THAT's why it wasnt' working
