## Git Commit Messages

The seven rules of a great Git commit message. Thanks to: https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/

1. Separate subject from body with a blank line
2. Limit the subject line to 50 characters
3. Capitalize the subject line
4. Do not end the subject line with a period
5. Use the imperative mood in the subject line
6. Wrap the body at 72 characters
7. Use the body to explain what and why vs. how
